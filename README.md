Module 21 deep-learning-challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called Deep_Learning_Challenge. This contines a Jupyter notebook file called starter_code which contains the code to complete steps 1 and 2 of the assingment and create a model to asses applicant sucess for Alphabet Soup. This model was then attempted to be optimised by binning the ASK_AMT column in the file AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation Attempt 1. As this did not produce a more accurate model further optimisation was done in the file AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation Attempt 2 and 3. A written report explaining the optimisation and analysis is contained in the word file REport. The model weights and final models were also saved in this folder as various H5 files. The pandas codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. Information about random forests was collected from https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest, instructions on how to save as H5 were collected from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51186330/save-model-weights-at-the-end-of-every-n-epochs.
